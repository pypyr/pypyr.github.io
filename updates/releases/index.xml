ATTENTION: Please start preparing all your pipelines to be ready for the next major release where in context arguments will be removed from context on step completion. This shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too much of an issue. For any steps where you need to set enduring context, use contextsetf or contextset.
Allow using a call control-of-flow instruction nested inside while/for/retry loops.</description></item><item><title>release v3.1.0</title><link>https://pypyr.io/updates/releases/v3.1.0/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2020 19:24:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pypyr.io/updates/releases/v3.1.0/</guid><description>pypyr release v3.1.0 permalink API change to main entrypoint for logging permalinkRelease Date: 2020-02-11T19:24:11Z
pypyr.log.logger.set_root_logger(log_level, log_path) call moved from pipelinerunner.main() to cli.main()
this has the side-effect that pipelinerunner.main() signature has changed, with log_level and log_path removed. API consumers should update.
Reason being API consumers should set their own log handlers, since handler configuration should be the prerogative of the calling application, not the invoked library.

This one is all @Reskov üéâ eternal gratitude!
new NOTIFY logging level added. this level is much less verbose than even INFO, and only displays explicits echos that you specify in your pipeline, and also the description from the step decorator. This should make it much easier to see what your pipeline is doing without the extra detail that can make things confusing and harder to follow.</description></item><item><title>release v2.10.0</title><link>https://pypyr.io/updates/releases/v2.10.0/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2019 08:48:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pypyr.io/updates/releases/v2.10.0/</guid><description>pypyr release v2.10.0 permalink Better Errors - line numbers, save errors permalinkRelease Date: 2019-07-10T08:48:32Z

The new pypyr.steps.pathcheck step allows you see if a path exists on the filesystem. It supports literal paths and glob expansions. It writes handy values into pathCheckOutwith bool for existence and count of files found for the given path. #114 deprecate old style multi context inputs for fetchjson and fetchyaml, #118. this is not just arbitrary: reason is when step is used multiple times in same pipeline, it becomes easy to have left-over values from previous step run left in context that then cause surprising behaviour with the downstream step.</description></item><item><title>release v2.3.0</title><link>https://pypyr.io/updates/releases/v2.3.0/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jan 2019 02:18:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pypyr.io/updates/releases/v2.3.0/</guid><description>pypyr release v2.3.0 permalink pypyr.steps.getenv permalinkRelease Date: 2019-01-24T02:18:47Z

This release is all @Reskov! üéâ Much thanks for your excellent contributions to some tricky bits of the pypyr core!
Context KeyNotInContextError now also derives from KeyError. This makes it easier to catch missing key exceptions in scenarios where Context keys contain other dicts. Allow dynamic loading of pipeline loaders. This allows core extensibility to load pipelines differently and from other places than the default file loader.</description></item><item><title>release v2.1.1</title><link>https://pypyr.io/updates/releases/v2.1.1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jan 2019 11:32:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pypyr.io/updates/releases/v2.1.1/</guid><description>pypyr release v2.1.1 permalink Write step description to logger INFO on step execution permalinkRelease Date: 2019-01-04T11:32:19Z

ATTENTION, FUTURE WARNING: all built-in steps that used to take multiple input keys now instead take a dict input. This makes life significantly easier if you re-run the step in the same pipeline in that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to clear down context before the subsequent step runs anymore. The old-style is now deprecated - for the moment pypyr will make the old-style work seamlessly for you by creating the new keys under the hood for you and raising a warning without stopping, but be aware legacy support will be removed on the next major release.</description></item><item><title>release v2.0.0</title><link>https://pypyr.io/updates/releases/v2.0.0/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Dec 2018 20:19:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pypyr.io/updates/releases/v2.0.0/</guid><description>pypyr release v2.0.0 permalink Sic Strings, Py Strings, Fetch into Key and file write yaml/json permalinkRelease Date: 2018-12-16T20:19:49Z
pypyr v2.0.0 release! BREAKING CHANGES: [sic] strings are now a lot better. Instead of relying on string-parsing on &amp;ldquo;[sic]&amp;rdquo; and the tricky use of quotes and double-quotes, now a structural yam tag identifies sic string, making it a whole lot simpler to write sic strings with special characters in them without escape sequences or having to deal with {blah} style eye-bleeding messes.</description></item><item><title>release v1.2.1</title><link>https://pypyr.io/updates/releases/v1.2.1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Nov 2018 11:07:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pypyr.io/updates/releases/v1.2.1/</guid><description>pypyr release v1.2.1 permalink no functional change: fix pype bug permalinkRelease Date: 2018-11-05T11:07:17Z
