The step writes the absolute path as a string to the python key in context.
This means that wherever you would&amp;rsquo;ve invoked python or python3 as a subprocess, you can instead use {python}. This will replace the {python} token with the absolute path of the Python executable that is currently running pypyr.</description></item><item><title>pypyr.steps.shell</title><link>https://pypyr.io/docs/steps/shell/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jul 2020 11:53:28 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://pypyr.io/docs/steps/shell/</guid><description>pypyr.steps.shell permalink run commands in default shell permalinkRuns the context value cmd in the default shell. On a sensible O/S, this is /bin/sh, or more recently zsh.
Do all the things you can&amp;rsquo;t do with cmd. cmd runs a program or executable, shell invokes the actual system shell. This means all your shell expressions are available, such as your favorite bashisms.
If you are just looking to run a command with arguments, you do not need to use shell, you can use cmd instead, which will incur less processing overhead.</description></item><item><title>pypyr.steps.cmd</title><link>https://pypyr.io/docs/steps/cmd/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jun 2020 21:38:57 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://pypyr.io/docs/steps/cmd/</guid><description>pypyr.steps.cmd permalink execute arbitrary external commands, applications &amp;amp; scripts permalinkRun a program, run an external script, application or command. Execute the executable you specify as a sub-process.
In cmd, you cannot use things like exit, return, shell pipes, filename wildcards, environment variable expansion, and expansion of ~ to a user&amp;rsquo;s home directory. Use pypyr.steps.shell for this instead. cmd runs a command, it does not invoke the shell.
